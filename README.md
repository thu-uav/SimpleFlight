This is the official repository of the paper "What Matters in Learning A Zero-Shot Sim-to-Real RL Policy for Quadrotor Control? A Comprehensive Study ". This repository is heavily based on https://github.com/btx0424/OmniDrones.git.

Overview of SimpleFlight. We begin with SysID and selective DR for quadrotor dynamics and low-level control. Next, an RL policy is trained in simulation to output CTBR for tracking arbitrary trajectories and zero-shot deployed directly on a real quadrotor. The training framework focuses on three key aspects, i.e., input space design, reward design, and training techniques, identifying five critical factors to enhance zero-shot deployment.

## Install

#### 1. Download Isaac Sim (local version)

Download the [Omniverse Isaac Sim (local version)](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim) and install the desired Isaac Sim release **(version 2022.2.0)** following the [official document](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/isaacsim/latest/installation/install_workstation.html). *Note that Omniverse Isaac Sim supports multi-user access, eliminating the need for repeated downloads and installations across different user accounts.*

Set the following environment variables to your ``~/.bashrc`` or ``~/.zshrc`` files :

```
# Isaac Sim root directory
export ISAACSIM_PATH="${HOME}/.local/share/ov/pkg/isaac_sim-2022.2.0"
```

*(Currently we use isaac_sim-2022.2.0. Whether other versions can work or not is not guaranteed. We provide a .zip flie for [isaac_sim-2022.2.0](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZrfhIkQVdRynthJ2FqGBC5jA93J6yEiZ/view?usp=sharing). For easy usage, we also provide a [guide](https://github.com/thu-uav/Multi-UAV-pursuit-evasion/issues/1#issuecomment-2573176995) on the correct usage of Isaac Sim 2022.)*

After adding the environment variable, apply the changes by running:
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### 2. Conda

Although Isaac Sim comes with a built-in Python environment, we recommend using a seperate conda environment which is more flexible. We provide scripts to automate environment setup when activating/deactivating a conda environment at ``SimpleFlight/conda_setup``.

```
conda create -n sim python=3.7
conda activate sim

# at SimpleFlight/
cp -r conda_setup/etc $CONDA_PREFIX
# re-activate the environment
conda activate sim
# install
pip install -e .

# verification
python -c "from omni.isaac.kit import SimulationApp"
# which torch is being used
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__path__)"
```

#### 3. Third Party Packages
SimpleFlight requires specific versions of the `tensordict` and `torchrl` packages. For the ``deploy`` branch, it supports `tensordict` version 0.1.2+5e6205c and `torchrl` version 0.1.1+e39e701. 

We manage these two packages using Git submodules to ensure that the correct versions are used. To initialize and update the submodules, follow these steps:

Get the submodules:
```
# at SimpleFlight/
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Pip install these two packages respectively:
```
# at SimpleFlight/
cd third_party/tensordict
pip install -e .
```
```
# at SimpleFlight/
cd third_party/torchrl
pip install -e .
```
#### 4. Verification
```
# at SimpleFlight/
cd scripts
python train.py headless=true wandb.mode=disabled total_frames=50000 task=Hover
```

#### 5. Working with VSCode

To enable features like linting and auto-completion with VSCode Python Extension, we need to let the extension recognize the extra paths we added during the setup process.

Create a file ``.vscode/settings.json`` at your workspace if it is not already there.

After activating the conda environment, run

```
printenv > .vscode/.python.env
``````

and edit ``.vscode/settings.json`` as:

```
{
    // ...
    "python.envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.vscode/.python.env",
}
```

## Usage 
This repo contains the simulation code for training our tracking policy. For running on the real Crazyflie, see the code here: https://github.com/thu-uav/crazyswarm_SimpleFlight. Weights of our tracking policy can be found in ``/SimpleFlight/models/deploy.pt``

The code is organized as follow:
```
cfg
|-- train.yaml
|-- algo
    |-- mappo.yaml
|-- task
    |-- Track.yaml
    |-- Hover.yaml
omni_drones
|-- envs
    |-- single
        |-- hover.py
        |-- track.py
scripts
|-- train.py
|-- eval.py
```

For policy training, 
```
# at SimpleFlight/
cd scripts
python train.py
```
Modifying training parameters via train.yaml
- `run_name` : the name of the training projects
- `defaults` `-task` : the name of the task.
- `mode` : online means that using wandb to visualize the training process

For policy evaluation,
```
python eval.py
```

For Track, modifying task parameters via Track.yaml
- `env` `num_envs` : the number of parallel environments
- `env` `max_episode_length` : the maximum length of an episode
- `use_eval`: set True to eliminate the randomness of the environment  for evaluation
- `eval_traj`: types of evaluation trajectories 
- `action_transform`: the low-level controller that converts CTBR commands to motor thrusts. use `PIDrate` for crazyflie

## Real-world Deployment
We deploy the policy on real [CrazyFlie 2.1](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/old-products/crazyflie-2-1/) quadrotors. The key parameters of dynamics model is listed as follow:
```
# in crazyflie.yaml
mass: 0.0321
inertia:
  xx: 1.4e-5
  xy: 0.0
  xz: 0.0
  yy: 1.4e-5
  yz: 0.0
  zz: 2.17e-5
force_constants: 2.350347298350041e-08
max_rotation_velocities: 2315
moment_constants: 7.24e-10
time_constant: 0.025
```

Note that we use Weights & Bias as the defaul visualizattion platform; to use Weights & Bias, please register and login to the platform first.
